give me a description of the ui structure for this home page, in plain text, from top to bottom. 
include only layout details and content blocks. don’t mention any styling or visual properties.

Create an image with UI components for a [project], describe the style e.g. dark theme, transparency, bold colours, thin lines, modern UI, rounded corners

Give me a description of this style in plain text, in order to replicate the styling for a design system.

Enter the description in the context box, specify that you want a design system. save the prompts in your project doc

Go through the flow, to vies the pages. 

If it doesn't give you a design system > in chatgpt; Give me the pages and their content needed for a design system in plain text.
